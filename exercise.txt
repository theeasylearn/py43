1) Create a parent class named Animal.

    The parent class should have methods like speak() (which returns a general message) and is_alive() (which returns True).

    Create two child classes, Dog and Cat, each inheriting from Animal.

    The Dog class should have a constructor that takes a dog's name and a method fetch() that returns a string indicating the dog is fetching a ball.

    The Cat class should have a constructor that takes a cat's name and a method climb() that returns a string about the cat climbing a tree.

    Both Dog and Cat should override the speak() method with animal-specific sounds.
